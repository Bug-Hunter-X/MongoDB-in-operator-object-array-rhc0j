# MongoDB $in Operator with Object in Array Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries. The `$in` operator is designed to match documents where a field value is present within an array of values.  However, this example incorrectly attempts to use an array containing an object within the `$in` operator.

## Bug Description
The bug arises from an incorrect usage of the `$in` operator, where the array provided to `$in` contains an object instead of simple values. MongoDB will not correctly interpret this and will not produce the expected results. 

## Bug Solution
The correct approach is to use the array of simple values directly in the `$in` operator, or use a more complex query structure that checks the object's properties if needed. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MongoDB instance and collection.
3. Insert documents into the collection.
4. Run `bug.js` to see the incorrect query.
5. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected query.
